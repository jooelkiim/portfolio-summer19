        <h3>Context</h3>
        <p>Wanderlust is an iOS app designed to help people find new travel destinations and plan trips.</p>
        <h3>Problem</h3>
        <p>The process of planning trips and vacations is time consuming and difficult, from first confirming a destination to choosing attractions to visit, and finally planning how to spend the limited time of the trip.</p>
        <p>To gain more context on the challenges of trip planning, I conducted a survey among peers who have recently gone on an international trip or vacation. The questions asked were:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Have you gone on a vacation or voluntary trip recently? What was the most difficult part of the planning process?</li>
          <li>How did you decide the destination of your last trip? How did you first learn of this location?</li>
          <li>Do you make itineraries or loose schedules when on trips? How accurately do you follow them?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The takeaways of these questions were mainly in two categories: discovery and scheduling. While some travelers have a set destination in mind, many find themselves searching for the perfect destination that will give them just the experience they are looking for—this process requires long hours of searching through Google to find and narrow down the candidates. Additionally, scheduling and creating itineraries for these trips is tedious, and these schedules are often ineffective due to unpredictable factors such as time and travel.</p>
        <h4 class="color-purple spacing-top--sm spacing-bottom-xs">Problem 1: Discovery</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>People may have an idea or a desire to go to a certain place, but not know what attractions or activities that place has to offer.</li>
          <li>People may know what kind of destination they want to visit, for example tropical or urban locations, but not know the top options in these categories</li>
          <li>It’s difficult to search for possible destinations given constraints such as budget, location and travel distance, desired experience, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4 class="color-purple spacing-top--sm spacing-bottom-xs">Problem 2: Scheduling</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Planning is time consuming, and set schedules are often not followed because of unpredictable factors such as time
            <ul>
              <li>Even with an itinerary, being in a new country or city often means people do not know what method of transportation they will take.</li>
              <li>Travelling with more than one person also creates delays and miscommunication, making a specific itinerary difficult to follow.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Goal</h3>
        <p>To help users find destinations they would love, and make the planning process easier and more flexible.</p>
        <p><b>KPIs:</b> Number of trips created, number of destinations saved, in-app surveys (how accurately did you follow the itinerary?)</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Wide selection of exclusive experiences and places to stay</li>
          <li>Verified, crowd-sourced reviews</li>

        <p><b>Limitations</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Difficult to explore things to do in specific locations</li>
          <li>Lack of organization to the adventures and experiences shown—why are these particular items recommended?</li>
          <li>No categorization of locations, for example by region (Southeast Asia)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Storyboard and Wireframes</h3>
         <p>To form the wireframes of various pages of the app, a storyboard was created starting from discovery of travel destinations to planning itineraries for trips. The flow starts with a page dedicated to showcasing locations with carousels used to group categories such as types of destinations, as well as the most popular ones. For people who have a destination in mind, the search bar can be used to quickly explore attractions in the area of interest.</p>
        <p>The next step in the storyboard is entering the types of destinations page to view categories such as tropical and urban, then tapping into tropical to see the full list of destinations in this category.</p>
        <p>The following 3 wireframes (Cancun, Chichen Itza, and Oxtun) demonstrate the details page for locations, attractions and restaurants. By entering the Cancun page, the user can see popular attractions in the city that they may want to save, and in the attractions page, the user can view nearby popular restaurants they may want to stop by.</p>
        <p>Finally in the saved tab, users can view the locations, places and restaurants they have “liked”, and a sticky CTA “Plan trip” is shown. When tapped, users will be able to create detailed itineraries based on the items of their saved list.</p>

        <h3>Reflection and Next Steps</h3>
        <p>Working on the Wanderlust app taught me a lot about product strategy (how my designs would actually be built by developers, how it could generate revenue, etc.) and iOS design patterns. One of the takeaways from this project is the importance of user research. It is difficult to know the thought process of how people tend to plan trips, from the destination, to choosing attractions and restaurants. This is further complicated by the fact that people have varying ways of planning trips. While I spoke with potential users among my peers, a more rigorous user testing method would have helped guide the design process and lead to stronger conclusions. Another takeaway is that while it is important to deeply understand design patterns of specific platforms such as iOS, it is also important to consider other platforms and how the design would adapt to them.</p>
        <p>The next step for this project is to run user testing sessions with the Figma prototype, as well as designing the scheduling flow allow users to turn saved items into a complete trip in the app. A social feature would also be added, which would allow multiple users to collaborate on the same trips.</p>
